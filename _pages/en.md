[Aloft Long Island City](https://aloftlongislandcitymanhattanview.com)

# Travel

The reception, breakfast, and hotels are in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. 

Williamsburg is easy to reach from Laguardia (LGA) and JFK airports. Newark (EWR) is doable, but it's a bit of a schlep.

# Ceremony

We will hold our ceremony at City Hall in Jersey City.

Since this is a small venue, we ask that only immediate family attend.

# Reception

After the ceremony, join us at [Moabet](https://moabetbrooklyn.com/) to celebrate!

We'll have delicious Israeli food, a DJ, Tel-Aviv-style photo magnets, and a Pittsburgh-style cookie table. Someone might get lifted up on a chair...we'll see.
